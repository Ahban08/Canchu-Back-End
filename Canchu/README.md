## MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
**Controller Folder**: This folder contains the controller files responsible for handling user requests, interacting with models, and determining the appropriate response. Controllers are responsible for controlling the application's logic.

**Model Folder**: The model folder contains the model files that define the structure of the data and encapsulate business logic. Models represent the application's data and handle database interactions.

**Router Folder**: In the router folder, you'll find files that define the routes and map HTTP requests to controller actions. Routers are responsible for directing incoming requests to the appropriate controller methods.

**Utils Folder**: The utils folder contains utility functions and helper modules that can be used across different parts of the application. These utilities simplify common tasks and promote code reusability.
